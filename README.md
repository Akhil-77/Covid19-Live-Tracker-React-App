# A Covid19 Live Tracker React App

Covid Tracker is a helpful project that provides users with a number of fascinating features, such as no page reloads and the collection of all information linked to the Corona virus on a single web page.

This project is designed to provide its users with the best possible service by giving them access to a platform where they can get statistics and information on the corona virus both globally and by country, as well as in graphical and geographical displays. Despite the fact that the project is more frontend focused, dynamic data is also given equal priority. 

Asynchronous API calls to disease.sh are utilized to gather the data, which delivers dynamic data based on the call's destination. Simply said, disease.sh serves as a server to which we send GET requests to the supplied endpoints, and in response, it returns JSON data based on the endpoints.


## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to build a COVID Tracker that displays real-time data on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide. The project will provide an interactive dashboard with visualizations of the data such as charts and maps, to help users understand the scope and severity of the outbreak.
